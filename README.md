# Introduction

The short-term memory is more complex than my expectation. And it varies from different people. I want to find out the connection between short-term memory and long-term memory.

## Dataset

The dataset comes from 10 thousand users who use Anki, a flashcard app. In total, this dataset contains information about ~727 million reviews of flashcards. The full dataset is hosted on Hugging Face Datasets: [open-spaced-repetition/anki-revlogs-10k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-spaced-repetition/anki-revlogs-10k).

## Findings

The memory stability also increases during the short-term schedule.

The heterogeneity is more obvious in the short-term schedule.

## Next Step

Need to analyze the impact of multiple learning steps on the long-term memory.
