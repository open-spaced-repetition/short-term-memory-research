# Introduction

The short-term memory is more complex than my expectation. And it varies from different people. I want to find out the connection between short-term memory and long-term memory.

## Findings

The memory stability also increases during the short-term schedule.

The heterogeneity is more obvious in the short-term schedule.

## Next Step

Need to analyze the impact of multiple learning steps on the long-term memory.
